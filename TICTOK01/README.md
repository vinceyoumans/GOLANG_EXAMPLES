#  TICK TOCK
## Experiment in go Routines and Channels

`go run main.go m2.go structs.go`

The app starts 4 Go Routines that execute at separate times.
Each execution will print a message.

These times and messages are maintined in the shell.json file.
the Boom exectution end's the program

During execution, the messages can be changed.  Every Tick03 execution will
reset the message

Objective is to get a better way to work with the
time package as well as experiment.
